In a GSM network every antenna can have multiple frequency channels, which can range from 1 to 6. Every Carrier frequency in GSM is 200khz. While assigning frequency channels to the antennas in the network, there are multiple factors that need to be considered in order to have an optimized solution. The major problem in this project that is being addressed is interference, which can be occurred by the following parameters:

- Distance between transmitters
- Geographical position
- Power of the signals
- Direction in which signals are transmitted
- Weather conditions
- Assigned frequencies
- Co-channel interference 
- Adjacent-channel interference  
  
To minimise the interference, this project proposes an algorithm.
The simulator assigns the frequencies to the antennas provided as inputs to the simulator while considering the interferences.
